# Internship Report: Dashboard Project

## 1. Introduction
This project involved the development of an interactive dashboard website to visualize job analytics. The primary aim was to integrate multiple charts into a cohesive, responsive web application deployed on Netlify. The dashboard features dynamic visualizations that include time-based display logic—certain graphs are visible only between 3 PM IST and 5 PM IST.

## 2. Background
During the internship, I was tasked with designing and implementing a dashboard that meets specific business requirements. The key components included:
- **Chart 1**: Illustrating the relationship between country, job title, and role.
- **Chart 2**: Displaying the top 10 companies based on maximum Data Engineer roles and Data Scientist job titles. This chart applies multiple filters:
  - Excluding Asian countries, countries starting with "C," and those with latitude below 10.
  - Including only job postings from 01/01/2023 to 06/01/2023.
  - Considering only B.Tech qualifications and female preferences.
  - Visible only between 3 PM and 5 PM IST.
- **Chart 3**: Focusing on job listings from India and Germany (with India’s data highlighted in orange and Germany’s in green), filtered by:
  - Qualification (B.Tech), work type (Full time), experience (>2 years), specified job roles, salary (> $10k), posting date before 08/01/2023.
  - Posted on Indeed with female preference.
  - Visible only between 3 PM IST and 5 PM IST.

## 3. Learning Objectives
- **Technical Skills**: Enhance proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design.
- **Data Visualization**: Learn to integrate complex data filtering and visualization techniques.
- **Time-based Logic**: Implement conditional display of elements using JavaScript.
- **Deployment**: Gain hands-on experience in deploying responsive websites using Netlify.

## 4. Activities and Tasks
- **Task 1**:
  - Developed a chart that illustrates the relationship between country, job title, and role using relevant visualization tools.
- **Task 2**:
  - Created a visualization for the top 10 companies having maximum Data Engineer roles and Data Scientist job titles.
  - Applied filters to exclude Asian countries, ignore countries starting with the letter "C," and those with a latitude below 10.
  - Filtered job postings within the date range 01/01/2023 to 06/01/2023, focused solely on B.Tech qualifications and female preferences.
  - Incorporated JavaScript logic to display this chart only between 3 PM and 5 PM IST.
- **Task 3**:
  - Designed a chart highlighting job postings from India and Germany, with additional filters including qualification (B.Tech), work type (Full time), experience (>2 years), job roles (Data Scientist, Art Teacher, Aerospace Engineer), salary (above $10k), and job posting date (before 08/01/2023) with a preference for female candidates.
  - Used color coding (orange for India and green for Germany) and ensured the chart is visible only between 3 PM and 5 PM IST.
- **Website Integration & Deployment**:
  - Integrated all the tasks into a single, responsive dashboard.
  - **Live Demo**: [Dashboard Link](https://nullclass0task.netlify.app/)
  - Ensured compatibility across mobile devices and tablets.

## 5. Skills and Competencies
- **Web Development**: Advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills were applied to create dynamic web pages.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized various libraries and tools to generate insightful, interactive charts.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design principles to ensure usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackled challenges related to time-based logic and complex data filtering.
- **Deployment**: Gained practical experience in deploying modern web applications on Netlify.

## 6. Feedback and Evidence
- **User Feedback**: Received positive feedback on the clarity and interactivity of the dashboard.
- **Documentation**: Detailed screenshots and a well-documented GitHub repository serve as evidence of the work completed.
- **Live Demo**: The deployed website [Dashboard Link](https://nullclass0task.netlify.app/) demonstrates real-time functionality and responsiveness.

## 7. Challenges and Solutions
- **Time-based Display**:
  - **Challenge**: Ensuring that specific charts are only visible between 3 PM IST and 5 PM IST.
  - **Solution**: Employed JavaScript’s Date object to perform accurate timezone conversions and conditional rendering.
- **Complex Filtering**:
  - **Challenge**: Implementing multiple, complex filter conditions for the data visualizations.
  - **Solution**: Structured the data processing logic in a modular manner to ensure each condition was effectively applied.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - **Challenge**: Making the website fully responsive across various devices.
  - **Solution**: Utilized CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques to adapt the design to different screen sizes.

## 8. Outcomes and Impact
- **Successful Integration**: Developed a fully functional dashboard with dynamic, time-based visualizations.
- **Enhanced Skill Set**: Improved technical abilities in web development, data visualization, and responsive design.
- **Professional Growth**: Overcame significant challenges related to data filtering and display logic, contributing to my professional development.
- **User Engagement**: The project delivered a clear, interactive experience for end users, aiding data-driven decision-making.

## 9. Conclusion
This internship project provided a robust platform to apply and expand my technical skills in web development and data visualization. The challenges faced, particularly around implementing time-sensitive display logic and complex data filtering, were instrumental in deepening my problem-solving abilities. The final deployment on Netlify not only demonstrates the project’s technical success but also highlights its practical impact. Overall, the project has been a rewarding experience, laying a strong foundation for future work in data analytics and interactive dashboard development.
